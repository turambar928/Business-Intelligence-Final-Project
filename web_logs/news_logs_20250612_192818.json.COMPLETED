        "headline": "Tiger grinds to opening-round 70 without his best stuff at US Open",
        "content": "PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. - Tiger Woods didn't have his best stuff Thursday at the U.S. Open. It was an 18-hole grind, one Woods was able to manage admirably while carding a 1-under 70 in the opening round at Pebble Beach. RELATED: Leaderboard That leaves Woods five shots off leader and playing partner Justin Rose. He's still very much in good shape at T-28 on the leaderboard when he walked off the 18th green, doing what he's always figured out how to do over the years - post a number without his A game. Now he's firmly in the hunt entering Friday's 11:24 a.m. ET tee time with Jordan Spieth and Rose. Woods kept Thursday's round intact with his putter, most notably with a 30-foot make at the par-5 14th to earn par. That earned a big fist pump from Woods on a day when he was visibly frustrated with his iron play. Tiger is all about the par saves today. #USOpen pic.twitter.com/vASl0nPkgP - U.S. Open (USGA) (@usopengolf) June 14, 2019 U.S. OPEN: TV, streaming info | Photos | Tee times | Scores Woods was mostly accurate off the tee and put himself in good spots, but he still found himself scrambling around the greens to save par following sub-par approach shots. After a birdie at No. 4 to get to 1 under, Woods gave two back with an ugly double bogey at the par-3 fifth. His tee shot was a goner from the start, a double cross that sailed way left and traveled even further beyond the green after hitting a cart path. He chipped back over the green from there and couldn't get up and down, carding a double-bogey 5. Woods bounced back with consecutive birdies at the par-5 sixth hole and the par-3 seventh hole, where he dropped a 22-footer for birdie to get back under par on the round. He finished the round with 11 consecutive pars, including at the par-5 18th hole where he crushed his tee shot but cost himself a birdie chance after hitting his second into a tough spot in a greenside bunker. In the end he survived a classic U.S. Open grind, and he has to feel good about his chances to make a move Friday and position himself for a shot at major No. 16 come Sunday.

He revealed that he \"\"wasn't expecting\"\" for the pair's relationship to end. \"\"It was kind of not something I anticipated in my life, but you know, I've learned a lot from it,\"\" El Moussa, 37, told host RuPaul , 58. \"\" I can say I'm a much better person from going through what I went through. So I wouldn't change anything.\"\" The Flip or Flop star continued: \"\"It was my first marriage. So, we met when we were young. I was 24, she was 22. And then the day we met, we pretty much connected right away and, you know, we built a life together.\"\" When the RuPaul's Drag Race star asked El Moussa if he would consider getting married again, the reality personality confessed that \"\"if someone had asked me that question a few months ago, I would have said no.\"\" However, he admitted that he has \"\"hope\"\" that he will find love again. El Moussa and Anstead, 35, wed in 2009 before filing for divorce in 2017 citing \"\"irreconcilable differences\"\" as the reason for separation. The couple share daughter Taylor, 8, and son Brayden, 3 . In 2018, Anstead tied the knot with her now-husband, English television presenter Ant Anstead . It was announced in March that the couple are expecting their first child together . While El Moussa is still single, he is ready to mingle. The HGTV star told RuPaul on Thursday that he has dived back into the dating scene, but he admitted to having \"\"no luck yet.\"\" \"\"I have never been in such a good place mentally, financially, spiritually like, everything is perfect. So I am walking on eggshells when it comes to relationships right now, because everything is going so great,\"\" he revealed. \"\"My biggest feeling in life is that feeling of loss. I'm still scared to fall in love again, because I don't ever want to face that feeling.\"\" In April, El Moussa told Us Weekly that \"\"life's been going really well and everything's great.\"\" However, he admitted that the \"\"only thing missing in my life is a best friend, and that's one thing I do miss about a relationship.\"\" RuPaul premiered Monday, June 10, on FOX.

        "headline": "Lakers rumors: Los Angeles eyeing third max contract player, looking to shed salary",
        "content": "The Lakers are apparently looking to jettison salaries so they can add a third max-contract player to pair with LeBron James and the recently acquired Anthony Davis. ESPN reported Tuesday the Lakers are shopping the contracts of reserves Mo Wagner, Jemerrio Jones and Isaac Bonga to other teams. Those three young players, who combined to average 10.2 ppg last season in limited playing time, are set to earn around $5 million in 2019-20. If the Lakers can clear those spots, and get Davis to waive a $4.1 million trade bonus in his contract, they would have $32 million in available space for next season. That would enable Los Angeles to go after a max contract player along the lines of 76ers wing Jimmy Butler, Hornets guard Kemba Walker or Celtics guard Kyrie Irving. Of course, the Lakers' target could change overnight. They had reportedly been interested in Raptors star Kawhi Leonard, but he reportedly is not interested in playing for the Lakers. And Walker reportedly feels the same way. Even if the Lakers end up with a super trio of James, Davis, and another star, they will be strapped for depth. Beyond the aforementioned Wagner, Jones and Bonga, the only other player under contract for next season is forward Kyle Kuzma. That's a concern, given that James and Davis both missed time to injuries last season.

        "headline": "Here's why everyone is going to Portugal now",
        "content": "\"It's bright. Achingly bright. I squint in the sunlight as I drive, winding north from Lisbon in late afternoon. When I take a turnoff from the highway and emerge from a tunnel, I see my destination: Porto , shimmering in the Iberian sun. Awash in faded hues and tiles, Portugal's second largest city is a panorama of blue, yellow, brown, and green. The colors calm me; they soothe my eyes and slow me down. It's October and the breeze is cool. ( Read more about the top things to do in Lisbon .) Out of the car and walking a tangle of streets and alleyways, I follow a melody floating in the air and find a man with his old street organ. He has a fuzzy chicken pecking at seeds on a table, almost as if it's dancing to the music. Behind him, the sun has cast a silhouette, etched in light, of an organ grinder against a wall of buildings. It looks like a Hague School painting. I toss a euro into the man's basket, snap a photo, and keep walking. But not far. I can barely move a block without pausing to admire a stucco wall disappearing into shadows, the shimmer of a red-tiled rooftop, the brilliant reflection of sun hitting a white sheet of laundry hanging out to dry. For the past year or two, it seemed as if every other person I met said they had just been or were going to Portugal. They'd say Lisbon was lovely, the Alentejo timeless, Porto magical. When I asked why, their words seemed to fail. \"\"Go see for yourself,\"\" they'd say. ( See beautiful photos from a trip to Portugal. ) Now I'm one of them, camera in hand, seeking something elusive enlightenment that lasts, a way to hold onto the fleeting moments we have when we travel. The light filters through the streets like a stream through reeds. It plays tricks on where it'll land, splashing about, reflecting in beautiful, faceted angles. Click, the blue-and-white tiles; click, reflections of pastries in a window; click, dust kicked up by workers restoring centuries-old buildings. More scenes: the UNESCO-inscribed Monastery of Serra do Pilar , the Gothic Church of St. Francis, a man in a green fedora. People are gathering on the Dom Luís I Bridge to watch the sunset. At a riverside café, a family chatters and laughs as they nibble Porto's famous salted cod dish, bacalhau . Click. TO THE LIGHTHOUSE: NAZERÉ On the flight over, I sat next to a traveler who shared a not-very-well-kept secret: Nazaré is one of the most attractive beach towns in Portugal, with some of the largest waves in the world. Big-wave season is from October to May, and in November 2017 Brazilian surfer Rodrigo Koxa made history by riding an 80-foot roller, breaking the world record for the highest wave ever surfed. ( Check out more of the world's best beaches. ) Such mastery of the seas has a precedent. From the early 15th into the 17th centuries, Portuguese seafarers ruled the waves, launching a European age of discovery. Prince Henry the Navigator urged his captains ever onward in search of a route to India, leading to a vast trading empire that stretched from Africa and the Arabian Peninsula to South America and the Caribbean. Sailors navigated by the stars and relied on lighthouses to guide them safely away from the rocks. The Nazaré lighthouse has functioned since 1903, and it's the best overlook in the area, a front row seat on the surfing action. From the light's perch in a former fort, I see the wide white sands stretching out on either side of the promontory. Next to me, hardy surfers with beers in hand are scanning the water, planning their next waves. There's an autumn chill in the air, but I can imagine these sands teeming in the summertime. CITY OF REFLECTION: LISBON This city is crisp as a starched shirt. The scent of bread and scrubbed cobblestone lures me down through the capital's passages and narrow streets. An espresso, a convivial greeting, and a pastel de nata (an eggy custard tart) start the day. Customers lean on the Leitaria Académica café's glass counter and are attended to by a single, perfectly poised barista, accustomed to this morning choreography. As I walk the streets, the Castelo de São Jorge looms like a giant, its presence secured in history. Celts, Romans, Moors all called this place home at one point, each leaving behind a piece of their civilization for future residents to uncover. What strikes me most is the vitality of the city ancient and faded, but vibrant. Absorbed by the immensity, I keep missing the details. I'm drifting between the past and present. But then I shake free from my reflection when I see a beguiling church, or watch as college students dunk each other in a fountain, or pause for the changing of the guard in front of the Palácio de Belém . Suddenly I'm back in the moment, looking for the next street to turn down, the next vision to seize. LIGHTNING ON THE HORIZON: ALENTEJO I roll from hill to hill through the Alentejo region, a landscape soft on the eyes and the senses. Sunlight slices through the cork trees. A white bull, sleeping in a field, seems like a ghostly apparition. Pigs shuffle from one acorn ( bellota ) to another, foraging for the nutty flavor that gives Iberian ham its richness. Castles and churches dot the hilltops; they are relics from the past, yet they retain a power in the present. It's shoulder season, and the streets are empty save for a couple of stocky men, with weathered faces and hands, walking home from the pub. Olive trees frame the driveway of farm estate São Lourenço do Barroca l, outside Monsaraz. Some, the owners tell me, are more than a thousand years old. Gnarled, yet still dropping olives, one tree grows within a few yards of a Neolithic stone that has stood sentinel for nearly 5,000 years. I imagine the conversations these two monuments have shared over the centuries. A storm rolls in and the town of Monsaraz appears spectral against the lavender sky. Lightning strikes, and the last rays of the day struggle to penetrate an ominous thunderhead. THE GOLDEN HOUR: SAGRES I'm tired but the hotel concierge says go. He marks an X on the map and shoves the paper into my hands. You won't be sorry, he says. I drive quickly through the town of Sagres and take the three o'clock exit at the roundabout. Soon the land flattens out, and I see that cars are parked alongside the road. I keep driving until I find a spot to snuggle into. People are walking, laughing and talking excitedly as the wind whips their hair. The crowd's energy surges with anticipation. Something spectacular is about to happen. I arrive at the end of the road, to the westernmost point in Portugal. Atlantic waves crash against the cliffs of Sagres, seagulls ride the thermals, gliding ever higher. I settle into a gathering of about a hundred people as an orange glow bursts through the clouds. At first, a silence washes over us as we witness the end of the day at the end of the world. Then someone holds up a glass of wine to make a toast. The sky changes from orange to purple to pastel shades of pink and blue. We walk back to our cars slowly as shadows devour the last glimmers of light. Here's how to plan a trip to this radiant destination. Food and Drink Portugal's cuisine has long resisted the encroachments of fusion or molecular gastronomy. Hearty to a fault, family-run restaurants churn out satisfying variants of bacalhau (salted cod), piri-piri chicken, and ultrasweet cakes. But here are some recent attempts to shake up the Portuguese palate. Belcanto/Bairro do Avillez: Top chef José Avillez 's two dining meccas in Lisbon's Chiado neighborhood share a love of reinvented Portuguese food. Belcanto boasts two Michelin stars and exquisite dishes with names like \"\"The garden of the goose that laid the golden eggs.\"\" Bairro do Avillez is a sprawling space housing a casual taberna (tavern), market, and cabaret. O Paparico Within a rustic and intimate setting , an Alsatian executive chef goes beyond the classic and expected seafood dish bacalhau by playing with colors and combinations yet staying loyal to \"\"Portugality,\"\" the title of one tasting menu. Befitting one of the world's top capitals of viniculture, the wine cellar seems infinite and the bar is worth lingering over. Peixaria da Esquina: Another of Portugal's cookbook mainstays, Vítor Sobral has opened modestly priced, casual tascas in Lisbon and Brazil that hew closer to traditional flavors yet with lightness and flair, such as Azorean tuna with mango, peppers, and pennyroyal. At his allseafood showcase Peixaria da Esquina , try the squid sautéed with shiitake mushrooms, broad beans, and coriander. Epur: Opened a year ago, this restaurant is a harbinger of Portuguese cuisine's future. The chef is French, the menu and decor, minimalist. Dishes honor the restaurant's name in their focus on essential local ingredients. From rabbit to tuna to prized \"\"black pork,\"\" these dishes don't so much shout as gently hum. Located across the street from the national art school, the dining room also has one of the city's best panoramas. Majestic Café: If you tire of experimentation and seek a proper finish to the meal or if you're famished after an afternoon's amblings this pastry palace is a classic of the genre, along with Lisbon's Pastelaria Versailles . Approaching their centennials, both are resplendently mirrored examples of a beaux arts heyday. Do as the locals do: Pair an eggy pastry with a strong bica (espresso). WATCH: Dive into the natural swimming pools of Portugal's Madeira Island Places to Stay Rooms in Portugal come with a view, as well as considerable historic and architectural heft. While state-run pousadas (inns), housed in old palaces or convents, remain a unique experience, many newer lodges outdo them with cutting-edge spas and the chance to partake in agro-tourism. Martinhal Sagres Beach Family Resort: This upscale resort in Algarve caters to multigenerational travelers. Adults can sip cocktails as kids learn how to surf. A concierge provides strollers, high chairs, or bottle sterilizers. Verride ...",

        "content": "\"Groceries, electricity bills, tuition and kids' tutoring fees: These are some of the recurring costs that Stockton, California, resident Tomas Vargas Jr. can now afford, thanks to the $500 per month he's receiving from the local government. Vargas Jr., a participant in the Stockton Economic Empowerment Demonstration, or SEED, program, is among the 125 local residents who were randomly selected to partake in the country's first government-led experiment in guaranteed basic income . \"\"I was surprised, then shocked, and now I am grateful,\"\" Vargas Jr., 35, told CBS News of his inclusion in the pilot program. He said his family and close friends know about the stipend, which comes with no strings attached, but some others think it's too good to be true. \"\"It's not a secret. My friends and family know, but some people don't believe it,\"\" he said. The nitty-gritty The demonstration was spearheaded by the Economic Security Project, a network focused on basic income in the U.S., in concert with Stockton Mayor Michael Tubbs, who envisioned using the stipend as a way to level the economic playing field. The privately funded program made the first of 18 disbursements in February. Recipients had to be adults living in a Stockton neighborhood where the median income was at or below the city median of $46,033 a year. It used a randomized selection process to ensure fairness, and recipients have, as promised, received $500 a month since February through a prepaid debit card, to spend however they choose. \"\"Stockton's residents are working incredibly hard but falling further behind. Our number-one goal is to shine a spotlight on the reality that a majority of Americans are struggling to make ends meet. We also want to move forward the conversation about finding a solution to providing an economic floor for everyone,\"\" Mayor Tubbs told CBS News of the initiative. Related video: Basic universal income: Testing a weapon against economic insecurity A leg up for the future Vargas, who works part time as a supervisor at a logistics company while he earns a degree in business administration, lives in Stockton with his fianceé and the couple's two children: a 6-year-old son and 7-year-old daughter. He also has a 12-year-old son from a previous relationship. He doesn't have high school or college degrees, and said continuing his education would help him work his way up the professional ladder. Nor does he want his kids to face the same impediment, and has made their education one of the family's top priorities -- a decision that is reflected in how he has spent his stipend thus far. \"\"Now I am able to take my daughter and son for tutoring so they can be on track in school,\"\" he said of the extra funds. He is also using the cash cushion to prepare for a future without free money: After all, disbursements are set to end in August 2020. Vargas hopes investments in individual retirement plans will prevent his family from being jolted back to where it was before it was selected for SEED. \"\"It gives me an opportunity to sit there and make sure I have a monthly dividend after it ends,\"\" he said. Money can buy a better night's sleep The no-strings-attached stipend has also allowed Vargas to sleep better at night because he is secure about his family's finances. \"\"On a day-to-day basis I wake up a lot happier because I don't have to be stressed, and because I get more sleep,\"\" he said. Vargas once spent most of his waking hours working, taking on side gigs as a handyman, landscaper and car mechanic just to make ends meet. He now spends some of that time with his family, helping him be a better father, he said. \"\"It enables me to have more family time to spend learning what my kids did at school, or reading books with them at night and going to the park,\"\" he said. \"\"I don't have to take time away from my family because I would have to make money for those things I want to give them.\"\" National proposals, from Finland to the U.S. Studies of other cash transfer programs have linked a universal basic income to improved health and wellness outcomes . Finland gave residents free money and preliminary results show that a cash stipend for 2,000 unemployed citizens increased participants' overall wellbeing and reduced stress levels. Researcher Stacia Martin-West, who-led the Stockton program's recipient selection process, in February said the experiment was in part designed to study \"\"how if we change income volatility through a guaranteed income, how can you see positive outcomes related to health, anxiety, depression and physical functioning.\"\" The concept of a universal basic income has come into focus in the United States, where Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang has proposed what he calls a \"\"Freedom Dividend\"\" -- a $1,000 monthly universal basic income for all American adults over the age of 18, independent of one's work status or income. Yang's proposal would be funded by a 10 percent value-added tax, or VAT, on the production of goods and services that would generate $800 billion in revenue. \"\"The most direct and concrete way for the government to improve your life is to send you a check for $1,000 every month and let you spend it in whatever manner will benefit you the most. The government is not capable of a lot of things, but it is capable of sending large numbers of checks to large numbers of people promptly and reliably,\"\" Yang says on his website. Handing cash directly to residents can be the most effective form of public aid. \"\"Families know best what they need,\"\" said Dr. Amy Castro Baker, who co-led the recipient selection process for Stockton. \"\"When we come into research, we often have assumptions people don't know how to manage what they have. But what we find is that people are experts on their own lives,\"\" she said. Vargas emphasized how precious the extra cash is to him, noting that he hasn't spent any of it on meals at restaurants or impulse purchases. He's in it for the long haul, and hopes it will become an annuity. \"\"I am more interested in what I can put it in to get a dividend back instead of going to dinner and buying shoes,\"\" he said. \"\"At the end of the 18 months, I want it to end on a good note, not I just spent it on a bunch of nothing.\"\"\"",

        "headline": "'They just vanished': A business partner murdered a family of four with a sledgehammer, jury finds",
        "content": "\"Detectives finally knew for certain that the McStay family didn't disappear over the border into Mexico when, in November 2013, a motorcyclist found their remains buried high in the Mojave Desert. Subscribe to the Post Most newsletter: Today's most popular stories on The Washington Post A sledgehammer was buried next to them. Their skulls and jaws were shattered and fractured. None were wearing shoes, and the woman wore no shirt, just a bra speckled with white paint. That was a sign to detectives that the four dead bodies might be those of Joseph and Summer McStay and their two toddlers a case that had captivated a global news audience. The family of four had just moved into their Southern California home when they vanished on the night of Feb. 4, 2010. The paint was still fresh on the walls, the corners bordered by blue painter's tape and the floors covered in newspaper. Their beige five-story stucco home looked \"\"camped in rather than lived in,\"\" as one prosecutor would later put it. It seemed the McStays left without bothering to pack up. Two children's bowls full of popcorn were left uneaten on the couch. Bananas and a carton of eggs were left rotting on the counter. Their dogs were left in the yard, their bank accounts untouched. But for years, in the absence of evidence of foul play, everyone from investigators to strangers who heard about the case on mystery TV shows grew to believe that perhaps the McStays had disappeared on purpose. Some claimed to have sighted the family alive in Indiana or Montana or Baja California. Others thought the McStays slipped over the border into Mexico, their SUV having been found abandoned near the border. The discovery of their bodies, however, silenced all the wild theories and finally Charles \"\"Chase\"\" Merritt, the last man to see Joseph McStay alive, knew police were coming to see him. \"\"San Bernardino County have said they are going to start the investigation over from the beginning,\"\" Merritt, 62, McStay's business partner, told the Daily Mail shortly after the bodies were found, \"\"and if they do, they'll have to talk to me.\"\" On Monday, a jury convicted Merritt of bludgeoning the family to death after his business relationship with McStay fell apart, bringing the nearly decade-long saga to a close and making Merritt eligible for the death penalty. In a trial that began in January and lasted more than 50 days, prosecutors presented heaps of circumstantial evidence they say tied Merritt to the slayings, including his cellphone records and banking records, but little to no physical evidence. Prosecutors argued Merritt was motivated by \"\"greed and self-interest,\"\" setting out to kill Joseph McStay, 40, after the businessman, who owned a company that sold water fountains, informed Merritt he owed him more than $42,000. Merritt's defense attorney, Rajan Maline, said the defense team was \"\"shell shocked\"\" by the conviction and intended to appeal. \"\"Based on the evidence, we did not expect this,\"\" Maline said. \"\"From our standpoint, our client is innocent. So the fight doesn't stop here with us. We will continue to fight for our client, because we believe in his innocence.\"\" Before Merritt was even arrested in the case, he was asserting his innocence, claiming in his interview with the Daily Mail that McStay \"\"was my best friend.\"\" The two had known each other for three years, he said. Merritt built decorative indoor waterfalls for McStay's company, Earth Inspired Products. On the day the family disappeared, Merritt told police that he and Joseph McStay met for more than an hour at a Chick-fil-A to discuss an upcoming water-fountain project, according to testimony from the first detective to interview him, San Diego County Detective Troy Dugal. Prosecutors claim there's no evidence the meeting ever happened. Instead, they say, Merritt was plotting to kill him. Three days earlier, McStay was on the brink of firing Merritt, and sent him an email asking for the $42,000 he owed him after botching a job, prosecutors said. Rather than pay up, prosecutors claim, Merritt wrote himself checks through the company's online accounting site, QuickBooks which they believe was the betrayal that severed their relationship for good. At first, however, none of this was apparent to investigators intent on tracking down the missing family in mid-February 2010. \"\"The bottom line,\"\" Dugal told the Los Angeles Times in 2011, \"\"was that life was normal for the McStays up to Feb. 4, and on that day they just vanished.\"\" Theories about their possible escape to Mexico flourished as police revealed new details in the following days and months. The family's Isuzu Trooper had been spotted on surveillance pulling out of their driveway about 8 p.m. on Feb. 4 only to be abandoned and towed from a shopping center parking lot on Feb. 8 in San Ysidro, Calif., just across the border from Mexico. A search warrant executed on the family's computer uncovered recent Internet searches for \"\"What documents do children need for traveling to Mexico?\"\" A few months earlier, Summer, 43, ordered a Spanish-language education program, the Los Angeles Times reported in 2011. Investigators scoured hours of grainy surveillance footage from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection port of entry, zooming in on the fuzzy faces of thousands of people waltzing into Mexico. They focused in on a family of four, the parents holding hands with two little boys and decided it might have been the McStays and their kids, who were 3 and 4 years old. The San Diego Sheriff's Department handed the case over to the FBI in April 2013, believing the family was out of the country. But family members were skeptical. Would Joseph and Summer, who were in regular contact with their parents and siblings, really drop off the face of the earth without even leaving a note? And why, if they intended to disappear, would Joseph and Summer arrange for a painter to finish the job the following weekend, after they had already vanished? \"\"Why would my son, as smart as he was, take his family to a place that is so wildly dangerous right now?\"\" Joseph's father, Patrick McStay, told the Los Angeles Times in 2011. The evidence finally placing Merritt at the scene of the crime was his cellphone data, prosecutors said. On the day the McStays disappeared, Merritt's cellphone pinged off towers near the McStays' home in Fallbrook. Later, it pinged off a cell tower in the Mojave Desert near the site where the family was found buried. His DNA was also found on the steering wheel of the Isuzu Trooper, prosecutors said, although his defense attorneys maintained that was only because he had been in the car before and had contact with Joseph McStay. \"\"I wasn't in the desert. I don't know what to say about that,\"\" Merritt claimed in an interview with police played for the jury. Merritt had sought to clear his name and reputation ever since the bodies were discovered in the remote high desert. He claimed in an interview with the Daily Mail that McStay tried to call him at 8:28 p.m. the night of Feb. 4, but that he was watching a movie with his girlfriend and didn't answer, a decision he claimed to regret. He said he kept trying to reach him in the days after McStay's disappearance, and said he believed the killings were random, because \"\"I don't think any of his friends had anything to do with it,\"\" as he told CNN in 2014. But what he never denied was seeing McStay that day, before McStay and his family who were killed because they were witnesses, prosecutors said were buried in the desert. He told CNN: \"\"I am definitely the last person he saw.\"\" More from Morning Mix: It looked like a simple domestic murder. Then police learned about the alien reptile cult.

        "headline": "The Summer Hairstyle Taking Over Paris Right Now Is Actually SO Easy to Do",
        "content": "\"I couldn't pronounce \"\"s'il vous plait\"\" if a croissant depended on it, but even I know that the French have the best beauty tips. I couldn't pronounce \"\"s'il vous plait\"\" if a croissant depended on it, but even I know that the French have the best beauty tips . They've mastered the happy contradiction of chic and undone, uncovered the products that'll make you smell good and look glowy and maybe they'll even order you a café au lait if you ask nicely. More importantly for me: they've cracked the code on easy, model-off-duty hair . \"\"The Parisian way is always very effortless - nothing ever looks too 'made up,'\"\" said celebrity hairstylist and T3 brand ambassador Laura Polko . Exhibit A: the half-up knotted hairstyle that's all over the streets of Paris right now. \"\"I've been seeing this messy knot everywhere that looks like it'd be hard to do, but it's actually so easy.\"\" The key, as you might have guessed, is simplicity. \"\"This look gets the hair out of your face and still has texture because of the waves, but it doesn't look too polished,\"\" she said. \"\"Flyaways and looseness is what makes Parisian hair so desirable, so try not to focus on making it look perfect. It's the imperfections that make it cool.\"\" If the step-by-step ahead isn't convincing enough, let me attest: this half-up topknot style isn't just easy it'll also conjure a collective ooh, la la . Step 1: Curl Your Hair Want that messy, undone texture that matches the ripples of the ocean? First you have to make waves with a curling iron. (Don't worry, you'll fuss it up later.) To start, divide your hair into sections. Then, grab the Tapered Styling Wand from the T3 Whirl Trio Interchangeable Curling Iron Set ($300) and curl one-inch sections all over. If you're not into the beachy wave look, you can also sub in the 1-inch straight barrel (which is included in the set and can be easily swapped out) for more uniform spirals. Step 2: Switch It Up For waves that evoke an \"\"imperfect\"\" Parisian vibe, alternate the direction of the curling iron for each one-inch section of hair. \"\"The only part of the style that needs any thought is the very front, and that's as far as which pieces you want left out to frame your face,\"\" Polko said. \"\"If you favor a middle part, direct the curl away from the face on either side of the part. For a side part, again, curl your hair away from the face, and use the wand to get lift at the root.\"\" Step 3: Pull Hair Back Into a Half Pony Next, use your fingers to rake out the curls so they don't look too defined. Divvy up half of your hair and loosely pull it back into a messy ponytail. \"\"Don't worry about making it look perfect,\"\" she said. Step 4: Create the Topknot Secure the style with a clear hair tie, but instead of pulling the ends all the way through, \"\"leave half of the hair still in the elastic,\"\" Polko said. This will create a loop. Step 5: Loosen Up To give the topknot a certain je ne sais quoi - in other words, make the loop look fuller and more undone - use your fingertips to loosen up the ends. Step 6: Do the Twist Rotate the loop upward, taking the style from a horizontal position to vertical, and tug on the ends sticking out from the elastic to give it a messier vibe. If you want the hair around your face to look equally disheveled, use your fingertips and tug away. Step 7: Add Texture Once you've repositioned the topknot, use the same T3 curling iron to revive any limp curls and add extra bend. \"\"Texture spray is always my go-to for this look,\"\" Polko said. (We used the IGK Beach Club Texture Spray ($29), but any formula with grit and hold will do.) Fuss up the style with your fingertips. Final Look Voila the easiest half-up hairstyle that's perfect for Summer. Call it a take on your classic French twist.\"",
