        "content": "\"No matter how weird or odd they may be, people tend to be really passionate about the landmarks that make their own state unique. From San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge to the Cloud Gate in Chicago, there are iconic monuments scattered throughout all of the 50 states. Some, however, are definitely more unusual than others. In Alabama, for instance, people take pride in unclaimed baggage. And over in Louisiana, one of the most popular gravesites is that of Nicolas Cage even though he isn't dead yet. For your amusement, we've rounded up the weirdest, yet most unique landmark every state is fiercely proud of. Hey, we all need something to stand for, right? And for more things that make each state unique, check out the One Obscure Fact We Bet You Didn't Know About Your State . Alabama: The Unclaimed Baggage Center Have you ever wondered where your \"\"missing\"\" luggage disappears to? Well, it's quite possible that your long-forgotten carry-on is sitting in a facility in Scottsboro, Alabama. This city is home to the Unclaimed Baggage Center , a one-of-a-kind store that sells lost or unclaimed airline luggage items. On the retail floor, you'll find everything from iPads to a $15,000 Rolex watch . The unique shop has become an iconic symbol and tourist attraction for the state of Alabama, hosting more than a million visitors annually from over 40 countries. Alaska: The Abandoned Igloo City Hotel What's a hotel without any guests? Just ask the Igloo City Hotel in Alaska. In 1960, craftsman Leon Smith began construction on Igloo City , hoping to create a unique hotel experience for visitors from all over the world. However, the 58-room igloo was still not up to building code standards by the time Smith passed away in 1999, and so his dream of the igloo being a guest-filled hotel never came to fruition. Today it stands as a place for travelers to visit and marvel at what might have been from the outside, that is. And if you want to experience insane hotels that are up and running, check out these 17 Floating Hotels That Are Simply Magical . Arizona: The Turquoise Arch McDonald's You won't find the iconic golden Mcdonald's arches in the town of Sedona, Arizona. Sedona is known for its natural beauty and the city fights to make sure nothing obstructs that. So, when a McDonald's was built in Sedona in 1993, city officials would only agree to a soft blue \"\"M\"\" as they felt the gold would clash with the land's surrounding red rocks. Though there are more than 36,000 McDonald's worldwide, this iconic Arizona destination is the only one to feature turquoise arches. Arkansas: The Mammoth Orange Cafe This orange cafe isn't in the business of selling actual oranges. Rather, the Mammoth Orange Cafe is a giant orange restaurant off the side of the road in Redfield, Arkansas, known for serving up fried delicacies like fried pie and fried catfish. And for more state trivia, check out the Most Common Street Name in Every State . California: Salvation Mountain In the desert of California, Salvation Mountain stands, featuring numerous Bible verses and religious murals. The expansive work of art was created over the course of 25 years by Leonard Knight as a tribute to Christianity. As a now-iconic symbol for California, the scenic hill has been featured over the years in everything from Kesha's \"\"Praying\"\" music video to the 2007 film Into the Wild . Colorado: World's Largest Fork There's a nationwide competition for the world's largest fork and Creede, Colorado, currently houses the frontrunner. Created to one-up another large fork in Missouri, this aluminum sculpture is 40-feet long and weighs more than 600 pounds. Connecticut: The Giant Frog Bridge A nearly 500-foot bridge spans the length of the Willimantic River in Connecticut. But what makes it so unique is not its size it's the four 11-foot bronze frog statues perched atop the spools of thread adorning its corners . Why frogs, you ask? Added by artist Leo Jensen in the early 1990s, local historians claim the sculptures were built to represent the 1754 \"\"Frog Fight\"\" during which many people mistook the sounds of dying frogs for foreigners coming to kill the town's residents. Delaware: The Giant Doctor Bag A giant doctor's bag sits outside the Apex Medical Center in Newark, Delaware. However, the only person fit to carry this bag around is a literal giant, seeing as it's nearly 20 feet tall! And for more odd sculptures in every state, check out The Ugliest Statue in Every State . Florida: The World's Largest Entertainment McDonald's Sure, you can find a McDonald's on pretty much every street corner in America, but only one of those is the world's largest entertainment McDonald's . The original closed its doors in 2015, but luckily the company decided to replace it with an even bigger and better one in Orlando, Florida, in 2016. This super-sized location features unique food items like pizza, cake, and pasta; a 22-foot-tall kids' play area; and more than 100 arcade games. Oh, and it's open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Georgia: The Tree That Owns Itself One of the weirdest things you'll find in Georgia is a tree with no owner . Aptly named the \"\"Tree That Owns Itself,\"\" this white oak in Athens, Georgia, was granted autonomy in the 19th century through a deed the land owner drew up before he died. As stated, the tree was given rights to the eight-foot plot of land it stood on and while the original tree was knocked down by a storm in 1942, neighbors planted a new tree in its spot to honor the original owner's wishes. And for more weird Southern facts, check out the 25 Craziest Facts About the South . Hawaii: The World's Largest Hedge Maze The Dole Plantation in Wahiawa, Hawaii, isn't just home to some of the juiciest pineapples in America; it also houses the world's largest hedge maze . At the company's plantation, you can snack on some juicy fruit while navigating your way through more than three acres of Hawaiian hedges. Idaho: The World's Largest Beagle This giant good boy is located in Cottonwood, Idaho at what's appropriately named Dog Bark Park. Possibly the world's largest beagle , this dog building is actually a small bed and breakfast that you can rent a room in. The beagle-shaped inn was built by a local husband and wife duo in 2003, and now features a gift shop and visitor center that attracts numerous dog-loving citizens every year. Illinois: The Brooks Catsup Bottle South of downtown Collinsville in Illinois stands the world's largest catsup bottle . (Yes, that's catsup, not ketchup.) Unfortunately, though, there's no condiment in this bottle. Built in 1949, the structure functions as a water tower instead. It's known for being an iconic, albeit strange landmark in Illinois and is even listed on the National Register of Historic Places . Indiana: The Martini-Drinking Elephant Perched on a wooden cart, this glasses-wearing and martini-glass-sipping pink elephant sits outside a local liquor store in Fortville, Indiana. When the statue isn't outside guarding the store, it's being paraded around in local holiday festivals. Iowa: The Hula Hoop Tree Covered in more than 50 hula hoops, this tree in Amber, Iowa, is certainly a weird fixture . According to locals, the tree was apparently adorned by two hula hoops after a storm and since then, colorful hoops have just appeared around its branches throughout the years. Kansas: The World's Largest Ball of Twine Probably one of the weirdest state landmarks on this list is the world's largest ball of twine in Cawker City, Kansas. Started by Frank Stoeber in 1953, the ball weighed nearly 5,000 pounds and stood at eight feet tall by 1961 when it was given as a gift to the city. Today, the ball of twine sits as an iconic Kansas tourist attraction and citizens still add twine to it every year at the annual Twine-athon. Kentucky: The \"\"Florence Y'all\"\" Water Tower Over the years, the Florence Y'all Water Tower has become an iconic Kentucky symbol. Located off the interstate in Florence, Kentucky, the developers of an up-and-coming mall gave the land to the city for the water tower in the early 1970s with the stipulation that it had to say \"\"Florence Mall.\"\" However, after legal concerns surrounding the advertisement of an unbuilt mall arose, city officials had to scramble and eventually cost-effectively changed the words to \"\"Florence Y'all.\"\" Louisiana: Nicolas Cage's Future Pyramid Tomb Surrounded by crumbling, century-old graves in New Orleans' oldest cemetery sits a modern, white pyramid marked as the future tomb of Nicolas Cage , who purchased the plot about a decade ago. It stands nine-feet-tall and has the Latin words \"\"omnia ab uno\"\" inscribed on it, meaning \"\"everything from one.\"\" Despite the actor still being alive, the odd sculpture has become a cultivating attraction for anyone in Louisiana. Maine: The L.L. Bean Boot This large boot , which sits outside the L.L. Bean flagship store in Freeport, Maine, is one of the state's most iconic landmarks . At 16-feet-tall, it is estimated to fit a size 410 foot (if that even exists). Maryland: Starry Night in Door Knobs Though Vincent Van Gogh's original Starry Night sits peacefully in New York City's Museum of Modern Art, you can get a glimpse of a re-imagined version in Bethesda, Maryland. Located on the side of a hardware store, the mural was created using more than 1,250 door knobs and door accessories by the store's owner, David Goldberg . Thanks to his work of art, Goldberg is now often referred to around town as David van Go-berg. And for more interesting tidbits about the art world, here are 25 Mind-Blowing Secrets Hidden in Famous Works of Art . Massachusetts: The Turtle Boy Statue This odd sculpture is very well-known in Massachusetts thanks to its less-than-kosher design of a nude, young boy riding a sea turtle. The sculpture located in Worcester, Massachusetts has inspired T-shirts, tours, and even an entire website . It was created by Charles Y. Harvey , though the art...",

        "content": "\"Despite its popularity and its distribution in places such as Flint, Michigan , bottled water might not be as safe as you think. A test conducted by California nonprofit Center for Environmental Health finds that two bottled water brands Peñafiel, owned by Keurig Dr. Pepper and Starkey, owned by Whole Foods contain levels of arsenic that are higher than tap water, violating state guidelines as a result. High levels of arsenic, California law states , can cause reproductive harm and cancer. Products that violate recommended state levels of arsenic have to be labeled with a warning. \"\"Customers typically purchase bottled water at exorbitantly high costs with the assumption that it is safer and healthier to drink than tap water, unaware that they are ingesting an extremely toxic metal linked to birth defects and cancer,\"\" said Michael Green, the organization's CEO, in a statement. Arsenic, cadmium and lead: Fruit juices, for kids and adults, may include heavy metals, study finds Studies also show that it can cause hormone disruption and organ damage, especially in children. It corroborates independent findings released earlier this year by Consumer Reports , which found that the same brands of water have nearly double the federal limit of arsenic in water. Keurig Doctor Pepper stopped production of Peñafiel for two weeks after the release of the initial Consumer Reports study, with proposals to improve water filtration. So far, the Food and Drug Administration has yet to recall either brand of bottled water. Peñafiel is currently sold at Target, Walmart and other vendors, while Starkey is sold at Whole Foods. Earlier this year, Consumer Reports found potentially harmful levels of metals including arsenic in fruit juices. Neither Whole Foods or Keurig Dr. Pepper have responded to requests for comment from USA TODAY. This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: High levels of arsenic in bottled water sold at Whole Foods, Target, Walmart, study says\"",

        "headline": "State Department identifies 23 violations, 'multiple security incidents' concerning Clinton emails",
        "content": "\"The State Department revealed Monday that it has identified \"\"multiple security incidents\"\" involving current or former employees' handling of Hillary Clinton's emails, and that 23 \"\"violations\"\" and seven \"\"infractions\"\" have been issued as part of the department's ongoing investigation. The information came in a letter to Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley, who is responsible for overseeing the review. \"\"To this point, the Department has assessed culpability to 15 individuals, some of whom were culpable in multiple security incidents,\"\" Mary Elizabeth Taylor, the State Department's Assistant Secretary in the Bureau of Legislative Affairs, wrote to Grassley. \"\"DS has issued 23 violations and 7 infractions incidents. ... This number will likely change as the review progresses.\"\" President Trump highlighted the finding in a tweet overnight, questioning whether Democrats would investigate and saying, \"\"This is really big.\"\" Wow! The State Department said it has identified 30 Security Incidents involving current or former employees and their handling of Crooked Hillary Clinton's Emails. @FoxNews This is really big. Never admitted before. Highly Classified Material. Will the Dems investigate this? Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 18, 2019 The State Department, calling the matter \"\"serious,\"\" said it expected to conclude the investigation by Sept. 1. The department acknowledged that the probe was unusually time-consuming. \"\"Given the volume of emails provided to the Department from former Secretary Clinton's private email server, the Department's process has been necessarily more complicated and complex requiring a significant dedication of time and resources,\"\" Taylor wrote. Taylor also noted that disciplinary consequences were pending. \"\"In every instance in which the Department found an individual to be culpable of a valid security violation or three or more infractions, the Department forwarded the outcome to the Bureau of Diplomatic Security's Office of Personnel Security and Suitability (DS/PSS), to be placed in the individuals' official security file,\"\" Taylor wrote. \"\"All valid security incidents are reviewed by DS and taken into account every time an individual's eligibility for access to classified information is considered. \"\"This referral occurred whether or not the individual was currently employed with the Department of State and such security files are kept indefinitely,\"\" Taylor added. \"\"Consistent with the referral policy, for individuals who were still employed with the Department at the time of adjudication, the Department referred all valid security violations or multiple infractions to the Bureau of Human Resources.\"\" The State Department declined to release the names of the employees, consistent with its procedures. The department promised another update once its review is completed. Clinton's private email use has remained in the spotlight, as the DOJ looks into potential misconduct in the handling of federal authorities' surveillance and intelligence operations in 2016. Then-FBI Director James Comey said in 2016 that Clinton's handling of classified information was \"\"extremely careless\"\" - remarks that were watered down from their original draft - but that \"\"no reasonable prosecutor\"\" would bring charges. It emerged earlier this year that then-FBI general counsel James Baker testified that he thought Clinton should have been prosecuted until he was convinced otherwise \"\"pretty late\"\" in the investigation. And, last month, a trove of partially redacted FBI documents from the agency's investigation into whether Clinton mishandled classified information - a probe known as the \"\"Midyear Exam\"\" -revealed that top Clinton aides were shocked at apparent attempts to hack her private email servers. The document release revealed numerous episodes in which the Clinton team either suspected it had been hacked or seemingly acknowledged that security measures had come up short. \"\"omg,\"\" top Clinton aide Huma Abedin wrote to Justin Cooper, the technology pro overseeing Clinton's private home-based email servers, when he told her shortly after midnight on Jan. 9, 2011, that \"\"someone was trying to hack us.\"\" And in March, it was revealed that the Justice Department \"\"negotiated\"\" an agreement with Clinton's legal team that ensured the FBI did not have access to emails on her private servers relating to the Clinton Foundation . Former FBI special agent Peter Strzok testified about the arrangement during a closed-door appearance before the House Judiciary Committee last summer, according to a transcript released this year. \"\"A significant filter team\"\" was employed at the FBI, Strzok said, to \"\"work through the various terms of the various consent agreements.\"\" Limitations imposed on agents' searches included date ranges and names of domains and people, Strzok said, among other categories. The agreement was reached, Strzok said, because \"\"according to the attorneys, we lacked probable cause to get a search warrant for those servers and projected that either it would take a very long time and/or it would be impossible to get to the point where we could obtain probable cause to get a warrant.\"\" Former Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz, who chaired the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee until 2017 and is now a Fox News contributor, said the arrangement signaled that agents wanted willful blindness. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"\"What's bizarre about this, is in any other situation, there's no possible way they would allow the potential perpetrator to self-select what the FBI gets to see,\"\" Chaffetz said, noting that the FBI was aware that the servers contained classified information in unclassified settings. \"\"The FBI should be the one to sort through those emails - not the Clinton attorneys.\"\" The DOJ's goal, Chaffetz said, was to \"\"make sure they hear no evil, see no evil - they had no interest in pursuing the truth.\"\"\"",

        "content": "\"Target could have lost an estimated $50 million in sales during a two-hour outage on Saturday that knocked out its registers nationwide, according to an analysis from Kantar Consulting. Target said an \"\"internal technology issue\"\" caused the outage, which prevented registers at its 1,850 US stores from completing purchases. This led to long lines, frustrated customers, and many abandoned shopping carts. Unfortunately for Target, the outage happened on a Saturday, which for many retailers is one of the busiest shopping days of the week. Bryan Gildenberg, chief knowledge officer at Kantar Consulting, estimated that about one-third of Target's $1.5 billion in weekly sales are generated on Saturdays. Related: Target cash registers across crash, creating massive lines of frustrated customers Based on this estimate, and the fact that most Target stores are open for 12 hours on Saturdays, it's possible that the company lost about $80 million in sales during the two-hour outage, according to Gildenberg's calculations. Target likely recouped some of those sales losses through customers shopping on the website instead, or returning to stores later to complete their purchases. That's how Gildenberg landed at $50 million as the possible cost of Target's downed registers. Bloomberg's Matthew Boyle first reported on the estimate. Target did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the $50 million estimate. The company will likely reveal more information on the costs of the outage during its next quarterly earnings report.\"",

        "headline": "Help! My Dad Found a Girlfriend Two Months After My Mom Died.",
        "content": "\"Dear Prudence, My mother died last fall after a battle with cancer. My father is 76 and a working psychiatrist. He was devoted to my mom for over 50 years but began a relationship with a co-worker within two months of her death. I want him to be happy, but he is acting like my mom died years ago and not a few months ago. At first I said I was OK with this, but I have realized that my initial reaction was made in a state of shock. Last month he brought her on vacation to the same house he and my mom rented just a few weeks before she died. He acts like it's no big deal, but every time I walk into the house, all I can see is my mother at the end of her life. I am still grieving the loss of my mom but feel like I can't share memories with him because his new partner is always with us. I know he has his own life to lead, but this is just weird, especially for someone who is a therapist. He would never counsel a patient to jump into a new relationship so quickly after the death of a spouse. How can I talk with him about how I'm feeling? We have always been very close, and now I feel like I'm hiding something huge from him. I'll be OK with him moving on once I have just a little more time. This just seems so very fast and disrespectful to my mom. Moved On Too Quickly for Me Your pain and distress at your father's new relationship are completely understandable. But it's clear from your letter that you two are not going to grieve in the same way. You've just lost your mother, and you need to talk about her, but you can't do that comfortably in front of your father's new girlfriend. But, at 76, your father knows he does not have many years left to live and does not have time to mourn in solitude. It's fair to say that he asked you to get to know his new girlfriend too soon and that he ought to have given you more time before introducing you to each other. And you have every right to revisit this conversation with him and to ask for a little bit of space: \"\"Dad, I want you to be happy, and I know you care a lot about [Girlfriend], but I'm not ready to spend a lot of time with her yet. I'm hoping we can set aside some time for the two of us to get together by ourselves. I also found being at the vacation home you had rented with Mom to be more difficult and painful than I anticipated, so I may not be able to go there again for a while.\"\" I would encourage you not to think of this as any sort of comment on your mother's life or how much she mattered to your father. His love for her and his desire to have a romantic partner at the end of his life don't have to cancel each other out. It is fast, but it's not necessarily disrespectful. Prioritize your own feelings by scheduling an appointment with a grief counselor, talking with your friends, and setting aside time to journal or take long walks or cry or all of the above. Set aside time that's just for you and your father to meet up, and wait a while before spending time with him and his new girlfriend again. Related gallery: 17 compliments strong couples give each other (provided by Mom.me) Dear Prudence, I have very noticeable and semi-recent self-harm scars on my upper arms and thighs, and with the weather in my city warming up, I know tank tops and shorts will expose them to people around me. My friends are unaware of my cutting, and I'm really anxious that one of them will ask why my bicep has a bunch of healed-over red marks on it. I don't want to scare anyone who asks, or possibly trigger someone else who's had traumatic experiences with self-harm, be it their own or someone else's. Is there a gentle way I can tell the truth without igniting worry? Is it better to lie and not risk hurting the people in my life with this information? If no one asks at all, do I have any obligation to explain why my arm has so many scars, where last summer it didn't? Sun Exposure You don't say whether you're seeing a doctor or a therapist to help you manage your relationship with your body and self-harm. If you aren't, I hope that you'll consider it. But it sounds like you're not concerned about the resurgence of another self-harming cycle so much as dealing with the aftermath, so I'll take you at your word. If your primary concern is protecting yourself from unwanted stares or awkward questions, you could buy some shorts a few inches longer than your usual style and swap out your tank tops for short-sleeve shirts. You won't have to swathe yourself in sweaters and long pants, but that extra bit of fabric might make you feel more comfortable for your first summer dealing with these new scars. That's only if you want to and if it would put you at ease you're not obligated to cover up because your scars are an imposition on the rest of the world. And I'd encourage you not to think of your scars as a potential trigger that you have to manage every time you put on a tank top. Many people have scars and burn marks and other physical signs of previous traumas. If you want to tell close friends, you could say, \"\"I have some scars on my arms and legs that I didn't used to have, and I wanted to talk to you about it before the next heat wave so you weren't surprised by it. I want you to know that I'm safe and doing well\"\" don't feel that you have to make any claims about yourself that aren't true, but it does sound like you're in a better place right now \"\"and I hope you'll help me in my recovery by not drawing attention to them.\"\" I can't promise you that your friends won't worry about you, but if you can offer them guidance in how best to care for you namely by not gawking or asking intrusive questions they'll be eager to follow your lead. It may also feel like a relief to share this information with your friends not because they can fix it, but because it is good to be known and loved. Good luck, and I hope you have a wonderful summer. If you or someone you know is considering suicide, please contact National Suicide Prevention Line at 1-800-273-TALK (8255), text \"\"help\"\" to the Crisis Text Line at 741-741 or go to https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org /. *** Dear Prudence, My cousin \"\"Richie\"\" recently discovered through a popular DNA testing service that there's a likelihood that the father who raised him, my uncle by marriage, was not his biological father. This would mean that his mother, my aunt, had an affair that nobody knew about. Both my aunt and uncle are deceased. Richie has always felt an \"\"otherness\"\" in his immediate family, so this news validated those feelings, and he's delighted. He has begun to tell his siblings and other cousins. I support him but am a bit skeptical of the results and would like him to take a real DNA test. Richie says the results are enough for him, but I'd like to know for sure before older family members learn the news because I think, at least at first, they'd be deeply upset by it. Do I have the right to encourage Richie to confirm the results? And if so, what would be the best way to do that? Ancestry Dilemma There are a number of reasons to be somewhat wary of DNA testing services, not least of which is data insecurity . I do think Richie has sufficient information to strongly suspect that his original results were accurate, but I agree that there's likely to be plenty of emotional fallout. If you can find a way to gently encourage him to seek confirmation with a follow-up test supervised by a doctor, you should do so. (\"\"Have you thought about confirming these results with a second test before you talk to the rest of the family about it? I don't want to tell you what to do, so if I'm overstepping, please let me know and I'll back off.\"\") But the fallout is likely coming either way, and there's not a lot you can do to either avoid or ameliorate it. The most you can do is try to support Richie and let him make his own choices. If some of your older relatives end up getting upset, you can offer your support to them as well, but you can't shield them from the question of his paternity, nor from his delight in finding out that he may have another biological family he never knew about. *** Dear Prudence, How do I respond when my father-in-law gives Bibles and other religious tomes to my children? We are Catholic but not super Catholic, and he recently became a minister (switching from Catholic to Methodist). I feel as if he is trying to send me a message I need to be somehow saved from something or he is worried about the souls of my semi-heathen children. Religious Gifts If these are just occasional gifts (like for birthdays or holidays) and you don't mind your kids having copies of A Plain Account of Christian Perfection or A Dissertation Concerning the Nature of True Virtue that they mostly don't read, you can stick to smiling and reminding them to say \"\"Thank you, Grandpa\"\" before opening the rest of their presents. If the gift-giving becomes constant or if it's accompanied by digs about your own religious observance, then it's fine for you to talk about this with your partner, who might have a sense of how best to bring it up with their father. This could be anything from a gentle suggestion like \"\"The kids have more than enough stuff right now, so they don't need any more presents. But if you want to get them something, I'm sure they'd enjoy an afternoon with you somewhere special, like a trip to the movies or the zoo or a concert,\"\" to the less gentle \"\"I'm afraid we don't have room in our library for any more books right now. We've really appreciated your generosity, but please don't waste your money buying any more, since we'd just have to donate them.\"\" If that fails, then your partner should step in to offer a more obvious intervention. *** Dear Prudence, I was not beaten or neglected, but my mom treated me (her daughter), from a young age, like her spouse, best friend, personal therapist, marriage counselor, and priest. I knew highly inappropriate things about her marriage to my dad and her past and was expected to guide her through these thin...",

        "headline": "U.S. Base in Iraq Hit By Rockets as New Photos Released Claiming to Show Iran Behind Gulf Attacks",
        "content": "\"An Iraqi military base where U.S. and allied coalition troops are stationed has been targeted by a rocket attack just as the Pentagon released new photos purporting to show Iran was behind recent attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman. The Iraqi military's official Security Media Cell reported Monday that \"\"a short time ago, three Katyusha rockets fell on Camp Taji,\"\" a military installation also known as Camp Cooke, located about 17 miles north of Baghdad. The apparent attack came just two days after unknown assailants fired rockets at Balad air base, another Iraqi installation where U.S. military personnel were present. No casualties were reported in the previous attack, though the Security Media Cell said more details would be forthcoming about the latest incident, which also came amid a spike in tensions between the U.S. and Iran, which has begun to scale back its commitments to a 2015 nuclear deal that the White House pulled out of completely on a year ago. President Donald Trump's decision to leave the deal despite it still being supported by Iran and fellow signatories China, the EU, France, Germany, Russia and the United Kingdom was accompanied by a \"\"maximum pressure\"\" campaign of strict sanctions designed to undermine the Islamic Republic's economy. As Tehran dismissed Washington's warnings of a heightened threat posed by Iranian forces and their allies in the Middle East, recent incidents have left the region on edge. Slideshow by photo services Iraq, which has close ties to both the U.S. and Iran, has found itself caught in the middle of the latest unrest as various Shiite Muslim paramilitaries supportive of Tehran threatened to expel U.S. troops, which have largely been present in the country since overthrowing its former government and attempting to quel a Sunni Muslim insurgency led first by Al-Qaeda and then the Islamic State militant group (ISIS). Iran, too, was active in battling these jihadis, but also accused the Pentagon of destabilizing the country, as Washington has accused Tehran of doing. Isolated rocket attacks have occurred near U.S. government facilities in past months and have usually been blamed by the Trump administration on Iran, which has denied any role. The U.S. has also accused Iran of being behind recent attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman, located less than 100 miles away from the Strait of Hormuz, the world's most important maritime oil route and the subject of dueling threats by both countries. Both U.S. and Iranian military personnel responded to the most recent incident, which occurred Thursday, but the Pentagon has released footage it claimed showed Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards removing an unexploded limpet mine from one of the damaged vessels, something purported to prove Tehran was behind the attacks. Iran has dismissed the charges, but on Monday the Pentagon released additional, clearer photos again alleging they tied the Revolutionary Guards to the scene. Also on Monday, Iranian ambassador to the U.K. Hamid Baeidinejad warned that Tehran and Washington were currently \"\"heading towards a confrontation.\"\" He called on the U.S. to end its sanctions policy, which he described as a form of \"\"economic terrorism.\"\" A number of experts have expressed skepticism toward the Trump administration's attempts to link Iran to recent attacks. Some drawing comparisons to former President George W. Bush's decision to invade Iraq based on charges that former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction and supported militant groups⁠ accusations that later proved to be false. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and others have specifically pointed to White House national security adviser John Bolton, an architect of the Bush administration's decision to invade Iraq, as potentially pushing the country toward another conflict in the Middle East. Zarif has grouped Bolton in with a so-called \"\"B-Team\"\" including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, U.A.E. President Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, all vocal critics of the Islamic Republic who he claimed sought war between the U.S. and Iran.

        "content": "\"President Donald Trump's trade policies cost Americans tens of billions of dollars through April, according to new estimates, even before major tariff escalations took place. The price tag of duties levied by the Trump administration added up to nearly $22 billion during that time period, the free-trade group Tariffs Hurt the Heartland said in a new report. That was before Trump more than doubled the tariff rate on $200 billion worth of Chinese products in May, so current totals are likely much higher. Senator Chuck Grassley, who is leading efforts to craft a bill that would seek to rein in presidential trade powers, has given the same estimate. US Customs and Border Protection has assessed more than $15.2 billion in tariffs on China and more than $6.5 billion from those levied on steel and aluminum imports, according to the Republican from Iowa. \"\"To be clear, American importers and consumers are paying for these tariffs,\"\" he said at a Senate Finance Committee hearing on Tuesday. \"\"$22 billion out of the pockets of hardworking Americans is not in our national best interest.\"\" Related video: How states are being impacted by the US-China trade war (provided by CNBC) While Trump and his administration claim that tariffs hurt foreign exporters, evidence suggests that businesses and consumers at home pay the price. \"\"The Trump administration is learning that it is hard to punish someone else by taxing yourself,\"\" said Adam Ozimek, the chief economist at Upwork. \"\"Tariffs harm the domestic economy in addition to those we are imposing them on, so it is difficult to really damage major trading partners significantly without doing a similar amount of economic damage at home.\"\" At the same time, retaliatory measures have hit American businesses hard. The Department of Agriculture expects farm exports to fall by nearly $2 billion to $141.5 billion in fiscal 2019, largely because of tariffs China levied last year to hit back against the Trump administration. Trump asserts that his trade wars will ultimately help Americans, by pressuring countries to change business practices he sees as unfair. Seeking to level the playing field for the US, he argues that any short-term pain will be worth it.\"",

        "headline": "He writes Trump's tweets and has been with Trump's campaign since day one",
        "content": "\"Since taking office in 2017 , President Donald Trump has seen a staff turnover rate higher than the previous five administrations, according to the Brookings Institute. Adding to the list of those who have come and gone will soon be White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders. Trump recently announced she would be leaving her position at the end of the June to return to her home state of Arkansas. Huckabee Sanders worked as part of Trump's administration since the first day of his presidency. Her departure leaves only a handful of staff who can claim they there were there since the start of his administration. They include: Stephen Miller: White House Senior Advisor Kellyanne Conway: Counselor to the President Stephanie Grisham: Press Secretary, Communications Director for the First Lady Dan Scavino Jr.: White House Director of Social Media, Assistant to the President A member of the final four, Scavino was part of Trump's campaign team on June 16, 2015, the day president announced his plans to pursue the office. Golf course origins Before this, he played a key role in the purchase of purchase of Trump National Golf Club, Hudson Valley, back when it was named Branton Woods Golf Course. Scavino, at the time, was an executive vice president running the Trump golf operation out of Trump National Golf Course, Westchester, after meeting the now-president while a teenager working as his caddie. He convinced his boss to take a ride with him north to see Branton Woods. \"\"I told him before we left, 'If you don't like this golf course at all, you can just get rid of me. Terminate me. So be it,\"\" Scavino told the Journal in June 2010. Trump didn't fire him. And, he hasn't since, though Scavino had left the Trump team briefly before rejoining to take part in the Presidential run. The New York Attorney General's office is currently investigating allegations that undocumented immigrants were bilked pay and had poor working conditions at the Westchester course. Scavino has denied any such knowledge of labor law violations. \"\"If such violations occurred and I had been aware, I would have immediately addressed it, and stopped them,\"\" Scavino said in a statement to the Washington Post. From outsider to incumbent: Donald Trump launches re-election campaign with rally in Florida The man behind @realDonaldTrump After serving on Trump's transition team, Scavino was named director of White House social media in December 2016, a title he's carried into the White House. \"\"Quite surreal, I will be joining the president in the White House and around the world,\"\" Scavino told the Journal via text in December 2016. At the time of his hiring in 2015, Trump had just over six million followers on his personal Twitter account. Today, Scavino and Trump both use the account to communicate directly to 61 million followers. Hope Hicks, former White House Communications Director for President Donald Trump, told the New York Times Magazine in 2018 that Scavino is \"\"the conductor of the Trump Train.\"\" Several of the president's personal tweets are written by Scavino himself, but he's also said Trump will dictate tweets to him. \"\"You could make the case that without Dan fulfilling his core mission of conveying the excitement, people wouldn't have realized that they were part of a movement,\"\" said Jason Miller, a chief spokesman for Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. \"\"It was absolutely critical in encouraging people to turn out.\"\" Scavino is said to talk with the president more than almost any other aide and Trump himself has said he'll often take Scavino's words of advice on issues, too. \"\"Oftentimes, I'll go through Dan. You know, I'll talk it over. And he can really be a very good sounding board,\"\" Trump told Politico . \"\"A lot of common sense. He's got a good grasp.\"\" When does Trump tweet and when does Scavino tweet for him? Scavino is often at meetings where the president is at, but operates behind the scenes, documenting Trump's moves in videos and photos and connecting directly with the president's base, firing off several of his tweets. Wired Magazine says text-only tweets sent between 6 p.m. and 10 a.m. are the most likely to be written by the president, due to his schedule and cable TV news viewing habits. If there's a thread of tweets, the magazine surmises Scavino is more likely to have written them. As far as spelling mistakes, White House officials have said off the record that Scavino has spell-checked some of Trump's tweets before sending them. So it's possible famous tweets about \"\"covfefe\"\" and recently, \"\"Prince of Whales,\"\" may have been typed out by the president himself. But the reality is, we just don't know. What we do know is engagement on Trump's posts have experienced a slight decline. According to an Axios article citing data from social monitoring platform Crowdtangle, the interaction rate on the tweets have dipped from .32% to .16% between June 2017 and May 2019. His tweet featuring a pro wrestling video showing him taking down a CNN logo was his top tweet, but his calls for unity following violence have also had a high rate of interaction.

        "content": "\"I miss seeing photos of Sasha and Malia Obama on the regular. But every now and then, the former first daughters are snapped by photographers while going about their lives. This time, the paparazzi shot them while they were vacationing in Avignon, France over the weekend (casual, right?). Michelle and Barack Obama were also there, but it was their daughters' stylish summer outfits that really captured my attention. I couldn't help but notice that Sasha, who was looking absolutely gorgeous, was dressed in a Reformation slip dress . In case you've missed it: the brand is taking over this summer. Just last week, Kaia Gerber , Jessica Alba , and Busy Philipps all stepped out wearing the trendy Lacey dress by Reformation ($248; reformation.com ). Sasha's dress is a bit more affordable, ringing up at $128 . It comes in three other colorways, but the 18-year-old chose a classic brown snakeskin print. She rounded out her look with a highly-coveted Gabriela Hearst bag and proved comfort is key with white sneakers. I can't forget to mention Malia's look, too. That backless halter, white pants, bucket bag, and her comfy, flat sandals are the recipe for a perfect summer look.

        "headline": "Man nabbed through novel DNA technique pleads guilty to murder",
        "content": "\"A Maryland man nabbed for murder through DNA and genetic genealogy has pleaded guilty to the crime -- shooting a man during a home invasion who died five years later, prosecutors said Monday. Fred Lee Frampton Jr., 33, pleaded guilty to one count of first-degree murder for the death of Michael Anthony Temple, who was shot in 2010 in Odenton, Maryland, the Anne Arundel County State's Attorney's Office said. Genetic genealogy -- a novel technique that compares unknown DNA evidence to public genetic databases to identify suspects through their family members -- has been called a \"\"game-changer\"\" in the effort to crack cold cases. (MORE: DNA, genetic genealogy led police to suspected killer in Maryland cold case) Since the arrest of the suspected \"\"Golden State Killer\"\" in April 2018, over 50 suspects have been identified through the technology, according to CeCe Moore, the chief genealogist at Parabon NanoLabs, which investigated Frampton's case among others. Moore has appeared as an expert in ABC News 20/20 episodes. On Feb. 2, 2010, two men invaded a home where they fought with those inside and shot Temple, leaving him a quadriplegic, police said. Temple told investigators he thought he stabbed the man who shot him, prosecutors said, and blood was collected from the knife. Temple died on June 18, 2015 -- more than five years later -- and his death was ruled a homicide, police said. (MORE: In 1976, a young couple was killed while camping. In 2019, police tricked the suspect into handing over his DNA) It took several more years after his death to zero in on the suspects. The break came through genetic genealogy. In 2018, analysts from Parabon NanoLabs traced an unknown suspect's family tree based on DNA left behind at the home invasion scene, and that led them to Frampton, officials said. In October 2018 detectives followed Frampton and watch him throw a coffee cup and a cigarette on the ground, said prosecutors. (MORE: How a DNA database's new policy is changing police access and could hinder solving cold cases) Both were collected for testing; DNA from the cup and cigarette was determined to share the same source of DNA found on the knife at the crime scene, prosecutors said. Frampton was arrested on Nov. 1, 2018 and \"\"confessed to the murder and home invasion,\"\" prosecutors said. A gun used in the crime was found at his home, prosecutors said. (MORE: Murderer executed in 1999 identified through DNA as man allegedly behind woman's 1979 cold case killing) The second suspect died from an overdose in March 2018, prosecutors said. \"\"Mr. Frampton will finally be held accountable for this violent home invasion that forever changed the life of Mr. Temple, his family and the surviving victims,\"\" Anne Arundel County State's Attorney Anne Colt Leitess said in a statement Monday. Frampton is set to be sentenced on Sept. 19 and he faces life in prison. (MORE: DJ admits to cold case murder after being linked through novel DNA technique, apologizes to victim's family in court) Frampton isn't the first conviction from DNA and genetic genealogy. In January a Pennsylvania DJ pleaded guilty to murdering a 25-year-old woman in 1992 after DNA genetic genealogy linked him to the cold case. Just last week a man who had been arrested through the novel technique was convicted by a Washington state jury of a young couple's 1987 double murder.\"",
