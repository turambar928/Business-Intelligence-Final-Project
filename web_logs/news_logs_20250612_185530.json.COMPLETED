        "content": "\"Expanding their family! Audrey Roloff and Jeremy Roloff are expecting their second child together. \"\"Baby #2 is coming in January!!! Ember is gonna be a big sister! ,\"\" the Little People, Big World alum captioned series of sweet family photos on Monday, July 1, via Instagram . \"\"We are so grateful and excited for this little blessing to join our family .\"\" View this post on Instagram Baby #2 is coming in January!!!üéâ Ember is gonna be a big sister!üòçüò≠ We are so grateful and excited for this little blessing to join our familyüíóüôèüèª A post shared by Audrey Mirabella Roloff (@audreyroloff) on Jul 1, 2019 at 12:56pm PDT Audrey, 27, and Jeremy, 29, are already the parents of 22-month-old Ember . The twosome tied the knot in September 2014. Back in April, the A Love Letter Life: Pursue Creatively, Date Intentionally, Love Faithfully authors told Us Weekly exclusively about their plans to have more children. \"\"We do want to have more kids,\"\" Audrey told Us at the time. \"\"We've always wanted to have a big family. ‚Ä¶ We don't put a timeline or a number on it, but Lord willing, we definitely want to have more kids and we'll take them one at a time.\"\" The pair also spoke candidly about keeping the spark alive between them after becoming parents. \"\"We've kind of lost that spontaneity that we once had, and so it just goes back to the concept of being intentional,\"\" Audrey explained on April 2. \"\"For us, dating intentionally requires some scheduling, some planning, some carving out some time. It's different now with kids, and so that's something that I think we've had to sort of shift a little. Before we could be a little bit more organic and spontaneous and have fun date nights, and now it's like, 'We gotta schedule the baby-sitter.'\"\" Jeremy added that the couple enjoy outdoor activities. \"\"I used to bike-ride a lot [but] I don't get the chance to do that as much as I wish,\"\" he said at the time. \"\"Audrey really likes to run and so it's kind of a special thing to revisit these areas that kind of made Audrey who she was, and me who I am, and we do those together now and it's really fun.\"\" Audrey and Jeremy's baby news comes nearly a year after they announced their departure from Little People, Big World. \"\"After 14 years, over 300 episodes, and 17 seasons, the time has come. A year ago, I made the decision that this season would be our last,\"\" Jeremy wrote in July 2018. \"\"It has been an amazing run, and I can't say thank you enough to all of you who have watched and supported us along the ride. We have the most loyal fans on TV and we appreciate every one of you. You are what made doing this so fun. We will still be supporting the family as they carry the #LPBW torch onward. This is a decision concerning Audrey and me specifically the show much go on!\"\" Related slideshow: Celebrity babies of 2019\"",

        "headline": "Irina Shayk Struts Down the Runway for the First Time Since Splitting from Bradley Cooper",
        "content": "\"Irina Shayk is moving on from Bradley Cooper in style! One week after PEOPLE confirmed that the supermodel, 33, and actor, 44, had called it quits after four years of dating , Shayk stepped out at her first public outing in Florence, Italy. Walking in the CR Runway x LuisaViaRoma 90th Anniversary Show on Thursday, a leather-clad Shayk looked fierce as she strutted down the runway wearing a black, form-fitting, strapless Ermanno Scervino dress. To complete the daring look, the supermodel rocked matching leather opera gloves, black stockings, and Dorateymur's \"\"Groupie Ankle Strap\"\" pointed-toe heels in black patent leather. Her hair was styled into a sleek bun. Later on, Shayk switched runway looks. Though she stuck with the black theme, this time, the model sported a Mugler design, which included a black pinstriped jacket and a matching knee-length skirt with a thigh-high slit. Adding a sexy touch to the bold design, Shayk wore a sheer black top underneath the low-cut blazer, a thick black scarf around her neck, and sheer black gloves. The star also kept on her stockings and patent leather heels from the previous look, adding a stocking clip that was displayed through her skirt's sexy slit. Prior to walking in the Italian fashion show, Shayk spent some time in Iceland and shared several photos from her trip on Instagram. The photos came just two days after news of her split from Cooper broke. In one snap, Shayk posed on a rock, wearing an off-the-shoulder grey top from the Italian clothing brand Falconeri paired with matching socks. Another candid photo from the trip also showed the model smiling as she posed with photographer Giampaolo Sgura and Ali Kavoussi, one of the managing partners of The Lions model agency. On Monday, Shayk turned up the heat and shared a sexy snap of herself standing on a large rock in front of a scenic waterfall. The model wore a black one-piece from the Italian lingerie brand Intimissimi as she struck a pose with her back facing the camera. She also posted scenic shots of a helicopter, glaciers and snow-covered mountains in Iceland to her Instagram story on Tuesday. Earlier this week, an entertainment source told PEOPLE that the ultra-private pair, who share 2-year-old daughter Lea De Seine , drifted apart while the actor was off shooting his directorial debut A Star Is Born , which went on to be nominated for eight Academy Awards. \"\"They tried to save the relationship but it had changed,\"\" the source said. \"\"Since Bradley and Irina have always been very private about their relationship few knew there was really for sure something going on,\"\" the source added. A source had previously told PEOPLE that, before news of their split became public, Cooper and Shayk had \"\"spent a lot of time apart.\"\" \"\"[Irina is] not focused on the celebrity part, or on the fame she just wants to protect her family ,\"\" the source shared. \"\"Bradley is very into work and is trying to take advantage of every career opportunity right now.\"\" A different source went on to tell PEOPLE that \"\"they were living totally separate lives.\"\" \"\"If he was in L.A., she's out of town, and if she was in town, he was out of town,\"\" the insider said.\"",

        "headline": "We tried Hard Rock Cafe's new 24-karat gold leaf burger, and we're not convinced it's better than a normal burger",
        "content": "\"Hard Rock Cafe just released a burger covered in 24-karat gold leaf. But there isn't much reason to get it unless you're looking for Instagram likes. The Hard Rock Cafe now sells a burger covered in 24-karat gold leaf. The 24-Karat Gold Leaf Steak Burger was introduced as part of the chain's new menu launch on June 14, and costs $24.99 at the Times Square restaurant. We tried the burger to find out what made it better than a normal burger. As part of the launch of its new menu on June 14, Hard Rock Cafe began offering the 24-Karat Gold Leaf Steak Burger. Described by the chain in a press release as a \"\"first-of-its-kind burger with bling,\"\" the burger contains a 1/2 lb patty covered in 24-karat edible gold leaf. When we heard of this gilded gut-buster, our question was: \"\"What makes this better than a burger without gold leaf on it?\"\" Our hypothesis: not much. Edible gold leaf is nothing new: Europeans have been consuming gold leaf in liquor for centuries , and gold leaf is sometimes used for \"\"warq,\"\" a traditional coating for sweets in India , although silver is more common. However, gold leaf is flavorless, and although some claim it has antimicrobial properties when consumed, its primary culinary use is as a garnish. We suspected that perhaps the only real value that the gold burger offered was Instagram value. But we wanted to try the burger for ourselves before making a final judgement. At the Hard Rock Cafe in Times Square, a PR representative told Business Insider that the restaurant's customers often come in looking to indulge. \"\"What could be more indulgent than a burger with gold in it?\"\" he said. Click through the slideshow above to see our review of 24-Karat Gold Leaf Steak Burger. Before we even entered the Hard Rock Cafe, the gold leaf burger was already being sold to us. But the advertisement didn't get us any closer to the answers we were looking for. For that, a taste test was required. Aside from added gold leaf, the gold leaf burger is basically the Legendary Burger without bacon and an onion ring. Therefore, we were surprised to see it contained almost 250 more calories than the Legendary Burger, according to the menu. The gold leaf burger also costs $7 more, $1 of which goes to charity. Unlike other Hard Rock burgers, which are usually staked through the heart with a steak knife, the gold leaf burger was served open-face to show off the gold-leaf-covered patty. All that glitters may not be gold, but this burger sure was. The burger comes with steak sauce. Pouring it over the gold leaf felt like blasphemy. Once the bun is on the burger, only a peep of gold is visible. It's a pretty satisfying cheeseburger with a thick, juicy patty and a pleasant bun. The potato bun was an excellent vehicle for the meat's juices. But the toppings were just OK, and the gold had no flavor. Typically, gold leaf food is designed to feature the garnish. This felt like suboptimal use of such a visual (and expensive) ingredient. As a reference point for judging the gold leaf burger, we also tried Hard Rock's flagship burger, the Legendary Burger. It's a lot like the gold leaf burger, except without the gold leaf and with an added onion ring and bacon. It looked simply delicious. Even if it was a bit of a squeeze. The Legendary Burger was delicious. The bacon and onion ring added a welcome crispy, salty kick, and their addition augmented the heavy meatiness of the patty. It was well-balanced overall, although the veggie toppings were also unimpressive. Although the gold leaf burger was still a pretty decent burger, we're not sure we'd pay the premium for it. It's a novelty item that might be worth it for the Instagram likes, but it doesn't taste as good as the original Legendary Burger. What's more indulgent than a burger with gold in it? As it turns out, when it comes to indulging your taste buds, a burger without gold in it.\"",

        "headline": "34 Things Not to Buy at Costco, Sam's, or BJ's",
        "content": "\"Club membership stores such as Costco and Sam's Club have amazing deals on items in bulk, but will those items get used, and is the lack of selection smart for the items on your list? We weigh in on condiments, meat, skincare, canned goods, bakery needs, detergents, furniture, clothing, and much more. Worst of the Warehouse Sam's Club, Costco, and BJ's Wholesale Club make items a bargain by selling them in bulk , but the savings don't always add up. Sometimes, shoppers are actually better off buying the small size. The following items are just a few of the warehouse-club wares worth avoiding. Related: Sam's Club or Costco: Which Has Better Prices? Condiment Packs Costco sells a Heinz \"\"picnic pack\"\" with two 32-ounce ketchups, one 28-ounce mustard, and one 26-fluid-ounce pickle relish. Condiments have a long fridge life , but it isn't indefinite: Relish lasts nine months, ketchup lasts six, and mayo lasts just two, according to the Department of Agriculture. Unless you're hosting a big event and will use all of this, stick to the supermarket. Diapers Parents know that Amazon, Target, Walmart, and outlets already have cheap diapers. Warehouse club diapers are inexpensive, but the smallest quantity available at Costco in size 1 (from newborns up to 14 pounds) is 192 diapers . A child might outgrow the size before the package runs out. Smaller quantities are available at Target and Amazon which have subscription services with delivery and discounted prices. Stylish Clothes and Shoes Costco and Sam's Club will occasionally offer club-only deals on Levi's jeans, Adidas sneakers, and Michael Kors handbags. But Costco admits it isn't a \"\"fashion retailer,\"\" which means designer labels that turn up under its roof aren't there to set trends. It might just be an unpopular style that a designer label is trying to unload quickly. Let taste be your guide. Luggage With department and discount stores so willing to offer coupons and discounts for luggage sets, warehouse stores such as Sam's Club seldom have the overall best deals on luggage. It pays to shop around before packing up. Cereal Unless you like one particular cereal and can stomach 40 to 70 ounces of it over several weeks, you're better off hitting supermarket sales and getting more variety. Sale prices often dip below even the best bulk prices if you can keep track of your ounce counts. Cooking Oil Vegetable, corn, sunflower, canola, and olive oil are good for only three to five months after opening, according to the USDA. Those sold at the warehouse stores are great for restaurants, but they're going to be tough to use at their freshest by a small family. Eggs Costco sells extra-large eggs in packs of two dozen for close to $5. Safeway's extra-large eggs are roughly the same price for the same amount. Meanwhile, eggs at a supermarket can typically cost up to 50 cents less per dozen at a supermarket than at a warehouse store. Processed Snacks Trust a writer who's made many a regrettable trip through the candy, chocolate, and cookie aisle: If you bring it home, you're going to eat it. You're also going to see it as an infinite supply and not take stock of how much you're snacking . Consider the higher price of smaller packaging a tax on your vices. Liquid Bleach While Clorox puts the shelf life of liquid bleach at one year, some consumers say it starts to break down well before that time. If you're a janitor, maybe a three-count box of 12-ounce bleach bottles will come in handy. If not, turn to small bottles of generic to save money. Books and Blu-Ray Discs You can get deals on books and Blu-ray discs just about anywhere online. Without a back catalog to choose from and stocking only premium items such as new-release hardcovers, new Blu-ray/DVD/Digital combo packs, or Disney items, books and Blu-ray discs are warehouses' impulse buys, which is why Costco puts them so close to the end of its loop, just before the snacks. Liquid and Cream Eye Makeup According to Good Housekeeping, those multipacks of mascara and liquid eyeliners go bad in just three months. Cream eyeshadows have only six months, which might also make them bad warehouse club purchases, but powder eye shadows and pencil liners are good for up to two years. Skincare Products There are some really gross reasons not to buy in bulk. Ointments and creams break down after three to 11 months; and stuff that comes into contact with the hands have short shelf lives and can cause bacterial infections . Baking Powder and Dry Yeast Anyone who's ended up with flat bread, cookies, or pastry by accident knows the shelf life of baking ingredients is finite. The USDA gives baking powder and dry yeast six months at best after it's open, which doesn't make for great bulk purchases unless making giant batches at a time. Flour Like other baking items, whole grain or whole wheat flour is good for only up to six months after opening, while processed white flour gets eight months in the pantry or a year in the fridge. Even occasional bakers should resist the 25-pound bag. Probiotics You can raid the bulk vitamin section for most items, but not probiotics. Those expire after roughly a year, with some requiring refrigeration to get there. Laundry Detergent Liquid laundry detergent starts to degrade within six months of being opened. The container sizes sold at warehouse stores can last multiple years, but will not be nearly as potent by the end of the bottle. Dishwasher Detergent Dishwasher detergent fares even worse than laundry detergent. According to Good Housekeeping, dishwasher detergent retains peak effectiveness for only three months. You're better off hand washing in dish soap, which lasts 18 months. Nuts and Seeds You'll get two to nine months out of a jar of nuts after you open it, but it'll smell and taste odd almost immediately afterward. They contain a lot of natural fats, which tend to go rancid after a while. Freezing helps, but buying in smaller amounts from supermarket bulk aisles or on sale is smart. Bread Your grandparents kept bread in the freezer and you could too ... but why? Bread gets marked down at supermarkets and bakeries based on freshness and isn't all that costly to begin with. Unless you crave more-expensive seeded and multigrain breads or feel the need to hoard loaves, just pick it up as needed and scrounge the supermarket bakery section. Spices McCormick, which wants to sell you more spices, says herbs and seasoning blends last one to three years, and whole and ground spices for two to four. But the USDA agrees, and that makes buying spices in bulk a good idea only if you're actually going to use them in that time. Cheap dollar-store spices and loose spices present better, more manageable options. Canned Foods Yes, those big boxes of cans look like a great buy, but canned goods reward the patient shopper. The Canned Food Alliance and its partner supermarkets host Canned Food Month every February and drop prices to just cents per can. Since canned goods have incredibly long shelf lives, we recommend checking out those sales before sprinting to warehouse stores. Soda Supermarkets use cheap soda as a loss leader to bring people into the store and buy more items. It's why soda so frequently appears at the entrance to a store, and it's why it is often cheaper at supermarkets than at warehouse clubs. Whole Grains Oats, rye, barley, dry beans, and even brown rice have life spans measured in months, or maybe a year if you freeze them, the USDA says. Though white rice can hang out for up to two years in a pantry, forgo the 25-pound bags of everything else and stick to manageable sizes. Cold and Flu Medication A bulk pack of Vicks DayQuil/NyQuil Liquicaps at Sam's Club comes out to 28 cents per capsule, while a 24-pack at Walmart tends to work out to around 36 cents per capsule. Though Harvard Health says even expired medications can still be effective , keeping it in bulk almost ensures it will lose some of its potency before it's finished. Fresh Produce This depends on the household. At Costco, cucumbers come in packs of three, peppers in packs of six, and cherry tomatoes in 2-pound containers. If you have enough salad nights in a week to knock them out, splurge. If you don't think that six-count bag of avocados will keep long enough to make it worthwhile, pass and pick up a few singles at the supermarket. Sugar It doesn't spoil, so a 25-pound bag of it can be a great buy. But the 25-pound bag of store-brand pure cane sugar at Walmart sells for less than the same quantity of Domino Pure Cane Sugar at Sam's Club. Sunscreen and Lotion Sunscreen and lotion last up to three years under ideal conditions, but exposing it to heat also causes it to lose effectiveness more quickly. Inexpensive as that multipack may be, check the expiration date and be honest about how much you'll actually use in a summer . Paper Products Big packages of paper towels, toilet paper, paper plates, and other paper goods are warehouse staples. But when Sam's Club's 15 rolls of 150-sheet paper towels go up against Walmart's 12 rolls of 168 sheets , the warehouse's $1.17 a roll isn't all that much better than Walmart's $1.25. Laptops Even electronics retailers such as Best Buy are routinely undersold by online shops, and the warehouse stores can't come close to matching the best deals. Though the location of the best laptop deals varies by season, it's almost never at a warehouse store. Pasta Spaghetti at Sam's Club is roughly $1 a pound for the generic brand. Pretty good, until you see the Walmart generic selling for 64 cents a pound. Milk A gallon of 2 percent milk at Sam's Club is $2.49. At Walmart , it's $2.48. A penny's savings is not why shoppers go to warehouse clubs. Furniture Not only are you limited to a warehouse store's meager furniture offerings, but there's no room for haggling and no wiggle room on pricing. An independent furniture store will likely cut a bigger break. Beer There are people out there who really love wa...",

        "content": "\"If you want your kid to grow up to be financially successful, a new study published in the journal JAMA Psychiatry says you should pay close attention to how they behave early on in life, particularly if they have trouble focusing. Researchers at the University of Montreal examined the link between the behavior of 2,850 Canadian kindergarteners in the 1980s and the salaries they made once they were in their 30s. The researchers looked at personality traits such as attention span, hyperactivity, physical aggression, obedience, anxiety, and sympathy levels and they found that several factors influenced their annual earnings later on in life. Among both boys and girls, the personality trait that was linked with making less money as adults was inattention, i.e. the inability to focus on tasks and the tendency to get easily distracted. RELATED VIDEO: Why Snoring in Toddlers Could Be a Sign They're Not Getting Enough Sleep [Provided by Inside Edition] For boys specifically, being more likely to help others at the age of five or six was associated with making more money, and refusing to share, being oppositional, and acting aggressive were associated with lower earnings. The researchers believe that parents and teachers should be especially mindful of these traits in children if they want them to grow up to be successful adults when it comes to finances. \"\"Our study suggests that kindergarten teachers can identify behaviors associated with lower earnings three decades later,\"\" Daniel Nagin , professor of public policy and statistics at Carnegie Mellon University's Heinz College and co-author of the study, said in a press release . \"\"Early monitoring and support for children who exhibit high levels of inattention, and for boys who exhibit high levels of aggression and opposition and low levels of prosocial behavior could have long-term socioeconomic advantages for those individuals and society.\"\" Study co-author Sylvana M. C√¥t√© , associate professor of social and preventative medicine at the University of Montreal, noted that \"\"early behaviors are modifiable, arguably more so than traditional factors associated with earnings, such as IQ and socioeconomic status, making them key targets for early intervention.\"\" She added: \"\"If early behavioral problems are associated with lower earnings, addressing these behaviors is essential to helping children through screenings and the development of intervention programs as early as possible.\"\" And for more on how your childhood paves the way for your success later in life, check out New Study Finds That Older Children Are Smarter Than Their Younger Siblings .\"",

        "content": "\"Anderson Cooper has always been content making his own money. The 52-year-old journalist's mother, artist and heiress Gloria Vanderbilt, died on Monday after a battle with stomach cancer. But although Vanderbilt was wealthy due to her successful business ventures as well as her late father being financier Reginald Vanderbilt, the heir to a railroad fortune, Cooper made it clear in a 2014 interview that his mother was not leaving him a trust fund. \"\"My mom's made clear to me that there's no trust fund. There's none of that,\"\" Cooper told a shocked Howard Stern during his appearance on the host's Sirius XM show. \"\" ... I'm doing fine on my own. I don't need any.\"\" He went on to explain why he didn't mind his mother not leaving him her considerable fortune. \"\"I don't believe in inheriting money,\"\" he said. \"\"I think it's an initiative sucker, I think it's a curse. Who's inherited a lot of money that has gone on to do things in their life? From the time I was growing up, if I felt like there was some pot of gold waiting for me, I don't know if I would have been so motivated.\"\" Cooper also pointed out that his mom made more money by herself than she inherited. \"\"We believe in working,\"\" he noted. \"\"She's the coolest person I know. She really is.\"\" Vanderbilt inherited a trust fund that was worth $5 million in 1925 (roughly $70 million today) after her father's death, and according to celebritynetworth.com , was worth $200 million at the time of her death. The late heiress made it clear throughout her life that she valued making her own money. In a 1985 interview with The New York Times , she said, \"\"I'm not knocking inherited money, but the money I've made has a reality to me that inherited money doesn't have.\"\" In a 2016 interview with CBS This Morning , Cooper said that both he and his mother didn't have much of a connection to the wealthy Vanderbilts. \"\"That name Vanderbilt has such baggage with it, such history, and I'm very glad I don't have that name, and my mom never felt much connection to the Vanderbilt family and I certainly didn't,\"\" Cooper said, noting that he always identified more with his late father, writer Wyatt Emory Cooper's, more down-to-earth roots in Mississippi. \"\"One of the happiest days for my mom, she called me and said, 'Somebody just referred to me as Anderson Cooper's mom.' Very happy that she's reached that stage of life.\"\" In Cooper's moving on-air eulogy for his mother, he talked about her complicated past. \"\"Gloria Vanderbilt lived her entire life in the public eye,\"\" he said while narrating a touching video. \"\"Born in 1924, her father, Reginald Vanderbilt, was heir to the Vanderbilt railroad fortune, but gambled away most of his inheritance, and died when my mom was just a baby. Gloria Morgan Vanderbilt, her mother, wasn't ready to be a mom or a widow.\"\" \"\"My mom grew up in France, not knowing anything about the Vanderbilt family or the money that she would inherit when she turned 21,\"\" he continued. \"\"She had no idea the trouble that money would create.\"\" Her family name continued to affect her as she grew up, after a judge granted custody to her aunt when she was 10 years old -- whom she barely knew at the time -- and fired her beloved nanny, whom she was close to. The intense custody battle was dubbed \"\"The Trial of the Century.\"\" \"\"As a teenager, she tried to avoid the spotlight, but reporters and cameramen would follow her everywhere,\"\" Cooper shared. \"\"She was determined to make something of her life, determined to make a name for herself and find the love and family that she so desperately craved.\"\" For more on Vanderbilt's extraordinary life as well as her and Cooper's unconventional mother-son relationship , watch the video below: Related slideshow: In Memoriam 2019: Remembering the stars we lost (Provided by Photo Services):\"",
